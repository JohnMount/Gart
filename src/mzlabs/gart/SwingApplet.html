      When this page is ready you should see a number of
      pictures.   This page produces
      "art" genetically.  To create a new picture select two parents.

<H2>Description</H2>

<P>This page is based on the 
International Genetic Art II site 
(by
      <A HREF="http://mzlabs.com/JohnMount/index.html">John Mount</A>,
<a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/user/wsr/Web/homepage.html">Scott Neal Reilly</a>
      and
      <A HREF="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mjw">Michael Witbrock</A>)
which ran from 1994 through 1996
(the <a href="http://www.geneticart.org">current site</a> seems to be stuck).
This site, in turn, was inspired by
the work of <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/user/wsr/Web/homepage.html">Scott Neal Reilly</a> which itself drew inspiration from 
Karl Sims.  The International Genetic Art II site was a very early example
of CGI scripts and HTML forms, which at the time were the only methods
available to produce interactive web pages.  The central site allowed
a consistent view (different users saw the same picture) and primative
collaboration (every user voted and votes affected everybody).
Some of the best pictures were photo-reproduced and displayed in
"The Coffee Tree" cafe in Pittsburgh PA.
This version is written in Java and works
directly in the user's browser.  This allows a much more reactive user
interface and removes the need for a central site.  However, without a central
site or protocol the system does not allow collaboration or learning.

<P>This page uses a genetic algorithm to create art (or, at least,
pretty pictures).
The "genetic" algorithm used is quite simple (and arbitrary):
<blockquote>
To breed two formulae a random subexpression of one is replaced
by a random subexpression of the other (the random subexpressions are
selected uniformly from all subexpressions of the parse-tree of the
formula).  Finally, mutation is applied which changes one of the operations
in the formula.  
</blockquote>
Sometimes instead of applying the genetic algorithm a random formula
is generated or a saved formula for the old International Genetic Art II
site is retrieved. 

<P>Scott's art exhibit used functions over the reals, this one
uses functions over the quaternions (4 dimensional vectors) and gets color
R/G/B values directly from three entries of the vectors.  Quaternions
were chosen because:
<UL>
<LI>They form a vector space (over the reals) large enough to conveniently
hold the three vales: R,G and B.
<LI>They form an associative division algebra over the reals 
(thus formulas over the
quaternions should have some of the same properties as the formulas used
in the first exhibit).
<LI>Many Quaternion operations have geometric interpretation 
(example: the functions orth1 and orth2 are 
orthogonal maps of euclidian 3-space).
<LI>The quaternions are somewhat unique (e.g.
any normed associative real division algebra is isomorphic to the reals,
complex numbers or the quaternions).
